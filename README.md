write memory to a program without any anticheats knowing.
this is just a poc, probably a shit ton of problems. i dont suggest actually trying to use in a project


how it works:


opens a handle to lssas

gets the window class and pid

exploits a usermode vulnerability to open a handle to any program (all access)

uses ur shitty pasted 4u4 r/w to write or read memory
